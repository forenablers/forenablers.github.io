These transaction history comes from a cashless parking provider(CPP) and basically are payments for parking in a particular zone at particular time.</p>\\n<p>Clients of CPP use the provided services once they are parked and want to pay for the parking. Therefore CPP receives transactions only for successful parkings - <em>client managed to park in that area</em>. </p>\\n<p>The stored <strong>successful parkings</strong> might be <em>false positives</em> since we don’t know where the client wanted to park <strong>initially</strong>. It is possible that the client wanted to park in one place but it was completely full so he ended up parking in another place far away from the initial destination point.</p>\\n<p>The conclusion is that <strong>transactions don’t have lables</strong> to train a model to predict parking availability.</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>//TODO: another approach - predict amount of parking spots</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>//TODO: when it is possible - chart</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>//TODO: our experement and unreliable result</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>//TODO: main conclusion - we have to collect data</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<h3>Data</h3>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>PRDB states for Parking Rights Data Base</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<div class=\\\"mermaid\\\">graph TD\\n    A[What data you have?] --> C{PRDB owner}\\n    C -->|Yes| D{Enforced}\\n    D --> |Yes| F{Buy time}\\n    D --> |No| B\\n    C --> |No| K{Major provider}\\n    K --> |No| B[Incomplete]\\n    K --> |Yes| D\\n    F --> |Yes| G[Inaccurate]\\n    F --> |No| H[Complete]</div>\",\"frontmatter\":{\"title\":\"Machine Learning and Parking Availability\",\"date\":\"July 19, 2012\",\"author\":\"\",\"authorProfileLink\":\"\"}}},\"pathContext\":{\"slug\":\"/pn-hackathon-2018/\",\"previous\":null,\"next\":{\"fields\":{\"slug\":\"/dont-lie-to-user/\"},\"frontmatter\":{\"title\":\"Do not lie to your user\"}}}}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./~/json-loader!./.cache/json/pn-hackathon-2018.json\n// module id = 531\n// module chunks = 198083073843898"],"sourceRoot":""}
