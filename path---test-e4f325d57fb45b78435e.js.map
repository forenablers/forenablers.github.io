Make the process of providing a feedback as easy as possible.</h2>\\n<p>People are lazy in a nature. It takes a lot of effort for the BETA testers to sit and write down anything in a free form, on the other hand it is quite easy to fill in a survey. Create a survey! Include important questions in it but don’t make it  too long - no more than 20 questions.

Send them a link to your survey and ask to fill it out mentioning that it wouldn’t take much time but will help you a lot.</p>\\n<p>After you performed all these steps you can seat and analyze the feedback you got.
