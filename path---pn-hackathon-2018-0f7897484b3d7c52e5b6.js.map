It can have different forms of course - binary(yes, no), or probability of availability(87% is available), or something else.</p>\\n<p><strong>The input data</strong> should have features that influence parking availability.</p>\\n<p>Desired data set could look like this:</p>\\n<table>\\n<thead>\\n<tr>\\n<th>input \\n<br />\\n curLat, curLon, destLat, destLon, day, minute</th>\\n<th>label (output) \\n<br />\\n availability</th>\\n</tr>\\n</thead>\\n<tbody>\\n<tr>\\n<td><code class=\\\"language-text\\\">52.3485772, 5.0082082, 52.356612, 4.895434, 244, 772</code></td>\\n<td><span style=\\\"color:#0a0\\\">\\ntrue\\n</span></td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td><code class=\\\"language-text\\\">52.3485241, 5.0082011, 52.356278, 4.995423, 345, 631</code></td>\\n<td><span style=\\\"color:#0a0\\\">\\ntrue\\n</span></td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td><code class=\\\"language-text\\\">52.3485789, 5.0082022, 52.353972, 4.995412, 134, 1083</code></td>\\n<td><span style=\\\"color:#f00\\\">\\nfalse\\n</span></td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td><code class=\\\"language-text\\\">52.3489271, 5.0082082, 52.356129, 4.993729, 245, 890</code></td>\\n<td><span style=\\\"color:#f00\\\">\\nfalse\\n</span></td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td><code class=\\\"language-text\\\">52.3485772, 5.0082090, 52.356605, 4.995392, 64, 402</code></td>\\n<td><span style=\\\"color:#0a0\\\">\\ntrue\\n</span></td>\\n</tr>\\n</tbody>\\n</table>\\n<p>Important part of the data set is the availability <strong>labels</strong>. The labels reflect the availability situation whether the parking was available(<span style=\\\"color:#0a0\\\">true</span>) or unavailable(<span style=\\\"color:#f00\\\">false</span>) at the given time in the given location. </p>\\n<p>Do we have these labels in provided data set?</p>\\n<h2>Cashless Parking Providers and data</h2>\\n<p>What data do we have in reality? As the problem states - we need to give a prediction based on <strong>transaction history</strong>. These transaction history comes from a cashless parking provider(CPP) and basically are payments for parking in a particular zone at particular time.</p>\\n<p>Clients of CPP use the provided services once they are parked and want to pay for the parking. Therefore CPP receives transactions only for successful parking - <em>client managed to park in a particular area, thus parking was available</em>.</p>\\n<p>What data we don’t have is the data about <strong>unsuccessful parkings</strong> because we don’t know where the client wanted to park <strong>initially</strong>. It is possible that the client wanted to park in one place but it was completely full so he ended up parking in another place far away from the initial destination point. In other words - client dealt with <strong>unavailable parking</strong> but this data <strong>was not captured</strong>.</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>Disclosure: all the data is anonymized according to the <a href=\\\"https://eugdpr.org/\\\">GDPR</a>.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\\n<p>The conclusion is that the <strong>transactions cannot be used as labeled training data set</strong> to train a model to predict parking availability.</p>\\n<p>Main outcome was that the CPP should start collecting feedback from the users with regard to the parking experience. Simple questions can be asked after user parked: </p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Have you parked where you initially wanted?</li>\\n<li>How long did it take to park?</li>\\n<li>Do you see more available parking spots nearby?</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>This feedback will allow building labeled training data set that will not depend on city specifics.</p>\\n<h2>Bonus</h2>\\n<h3>Availability = Amount of Free Spots?</h3>\\n<p>Can we derive availability from the amount of free parking spots? Whenever we can say that there will be <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">X</code> parking spots free, we can say that parking in the area is available.</p>\\n<p>In order to train our model to predict amount of free parking spots, our desired labeled training data set should look like:</p>\\n<table>\\n<thead>\\n<tr>\\n<th>input \\n<br />\\n curLat, curLon, destLat, destLon, day, minute</th>\\n<th>label (output) \\n<br />\\n amount of free parking spots</th>\\n</tr>\\n</thead>\\n<tbody>\\n<tr>\\n<td><code class=\\\"language-text\\\">52.3485772, 5.0082082, 52.356612, 4.895434, 244, 772</code></td>\\n<td><span style=\\\"color:#0a0\\\">\\n23\\n</span></td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td><code class=\\\"language-text\\\">52.3485241, 5.0082011, 52.356278, 4.995423, 345, 631</code></td>\\n<td><span style=\\\"color:#0a0\\\">\\n68\\n<span></td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td><code class=\\\"language-text\\\">52.3485789, 5.0082022, 52.353972, 4.995412, 134, 1083</code></td>\\n<td><span style=\\\"color:#f00\\\">\\n0\\n</span></td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td><code class=\\\"language-text\\\">52.3489271, 5.0082082, 52.356129, 4.993729, 245, 890</code></td>\\n<td><span style=\\\"color:#f00\\\">\\n0\\n</span></td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td><code class=\\\"language-text\\\">52.3485772, 5.0082090, 52.356605, 4.995392, 64, 402</code></td>\\n<td><span style=\\\"color:#0a0\\\">\\n45\\n<span></td>\\n</tr>\\n</tbody>\\n</table>\\n<p>In order to label the data we should know amount of free parking spots.

In couple minutes this spot gets occupied by another car that also creates a transaction. That can influence our estimations of parking space capacity by making it bigger.</p>\\n<p><strong>Are there special tariffs?</strong> In a case when residents don’t pay for the parking they will occupy a spot but it will not create a transaction.

We know who is pictured on each image: a cat or a dog.</p>\\n<p>\\n  <a\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-link\\\"\\n    href=\\\"/static/casndogs-b3c0a3acb51b96da704cb63ec641e860-778cc.jpg\\\"\\n    style=\\\"display: block\\\"\\n    target=\\\"_blank\\\"\\n    rel=\\\"noopener\\\"\\n  >\\n  \\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 590px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 75.07836990595611%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"Cats & Dogs\\\"\\n        title=\\\"\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/static/casndogs-b3c0a3acb51b96da704cb63ec641e860-f8fb9.jpg\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/static/casndogs-b3c0a3acb51b96da704cb63ec641e860-e8976.jpg 148w,\\n/static/casndogs-b3c0a3acb51b96da704cb63ec641e860-63df2.jpg 295w,\\n/static/casndogs-b3c0a3acb51b96da704cb63ec641e860-f8fb9.jpg 590w,\\n/static/casndogs-b3c0a3acb51b96da704cb63ec641e860-778cc.jpg 638w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  \\n  </a>\\n    </p>\\n<p>The knowledge of the output allows us to train the model in supervised manner. </p>\\n<h2>Parking Availability Training Data Set</h2>\\n<p>Now let’s try to answer the question - <strong>how our training data set should look like so that we could predict parking availability?</strong></p>\\n<p><strong>The output data</strong> should be either <em>parking is available</em> or <em>unavailable</em>. It can have different forms of course - binary(yes, no), or probability of availability(87% is available), or something else.</p>\\n<p><strong>The input data</strong> should have features that influence parking availability.</p>\\n<p>Desired data set could look like this:</p>\\n<table>\\n<thead>\\n<tr>\\n<th>input \\n<br />\\n curLat, curLon, destLat, destLon, day, minute</th>\\n<th>label (output) \\n<br />\\n availability</th>\\n</tr>\\n</thead>\\n<tbody>\\n<tr>\\n<td><code class=\\\"language-text\\\">52.3485772, 5.0082082, 52.356612, 4.895434, 244, 772</code></td>\\n<td><span style=\\\"color:#0a0\\\">\\ntrue\\n</span></td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td><code class=\\\"language-text\\\">52.3485241, 5.0082011, 52.356278, 4.995423, 345, 631</code></td>\\n<td><span style=\\\"color:#0a0\\\">\\ntrue\\n</span></td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td><code class=\\\"language-text\\\">52.3485789, 5.0082022, 52.353972, 4.995412, 134, 1083</code></td>\\n<td><span style=\\\"color:#f00\\\">\\nfalse\\n</span></td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td><code class=\\\"language-text\\\">52.3489271, 5.0082082, 52.356129, 4.993729, 245, 890</code></td>\\n<td><span style=\\\"color:#f00\\\">\\nfalse\\n</span></td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td><code class=\\\"language-text\\\">52.3485772, 5.0082090, 52.356605, 4.995392, 64, 402</code></td>\\n<td><span style=\\\"color:#0a0\\\">\\ntrue\\n</span></td>\\n</tr>\\n</tbody>\\n</table>\\n<p>Important part of the data set is the availability <strong>labels</strong>. The labels reflect the availability situation whether the parking was available(<span style=\\\"color:#0a0\\\">true</span>) or unavailable(<span style=\\\"color:#f00\\\">false</span>) at the given time in the given location. </p>\\n<p>Do we have these labels in provided data set?</p>\\n<h2>Cashless Parking Providers and data</h2>\\n<p>What data do we have in reality? As the problem states - we need to give a prediction based on <strong>transaction history</strong>. These transaction history comes from a cashless parking provider(CPP) and basically are payments for parking in a particular zone at particular time.</p>\\n<p>Clients of CPP use the provided services once they are parked and want to pay for the parking. Therefore CPP receives transactions only for successful parking - <em>client managed to park in a particular area, thus parking was available</em>.</p>\\n<p>What data we don’t have is the data about <strong>unsuccessful parkings</strong> because we don’t know where the client wanted to park <strong>initially</strong>. It is possible that the client wanted to park in one place but it was completely full so he ended up parking in another place far away from the initial destination point. In other words - client dealt with <strong>unavailable parking</strong> but this data <strong>was not captured</strong>.</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>Disclosure: all the data is anonymized according to the <a href=\\\"https://eugdpr.org/\\\">GDPR</a>.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\\n<p>The conclusion is that the <strong>transactions cannot be used as labeled training data set</strong> to train a model to predict parking availability.</p>\\n<p>Main outcome was that the CPP should start collecting feedback from the users with regard to the parking experience. Simple questions can be asked after user parked: </p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Have you parked where you initially wanted?</li>\\n<li>How long did it take to park?</li>\\n<li>Do you see more available parking spots nearby?</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>This feedback will allow building labeled training data set that will not depend on city specifics.</p>\\n<h2>Bonus</h2>\\n<h3>Availability = Amount of Free Spots?</h3>\\n<p>Can we derive availability from the amount of free parking spots? Whenever we can say that there will be <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">X</code> parking spots free, we can say that parking in the area is available.</p>\\n<p>In order to train our model to predict amount of free parking spots, our desired labeled training data set should look like:</p>\\n<table>\\n<thead>\\n<tr>\\n<th>input \\n<br />\\n curLat, curLon, destLat, destLon, day, minute</th>\\n<th>label (output) \\n<br />\\n amount of free parking spots</th>\\n</tr>\\n</thead>\\n<tbody>\\n<tr>\\n<td><code class=\\\"language-text\\\">52.3485772, 5.0082082, 52.356612, 4.895434, 244, 772</code></td>\\n<td><span style=\\\"color:#0a0\\\">\\n23\\n</span></td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td><code class=\\\"language-text\\\">52.3485241, 5.0082011, 52.356278, 4.995423, 345, 631</code></td>\\n<td><span style=\\\"color:#0a0\\\">\\n68\\n<span></td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td><code class=\\\"language-text\\\">52.3485789, 5.0082022, 52.353972, 4.995412, 134, 1083</code></td>\\n<td><span style=\\\"color:#f00\\\">\\n0\\n</span></td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td><code class=\\\"language-text\\\">52.3489271, 5.0082082, 52.356129, 4.993729, 245, 890</code></td>\\n<td><span style=\\\"color:#f00\\\">\\n0\\n</span></td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td><code class=\\\"language-text\\\">52.3485772, 5.0082090, 52.356605, 4.995392, 64, 402</code></td>\\n<td><span style=\\\"color:#0a0\\\">\\n45\\n<span></td>\\n</tr>\\n</tbody>\\n</table>\\n<p>In order to label the data we should know amount of free parking spots.

This will lead to situation where we see that there are 5 free parking spots, however they are occupied without paying.</p>\\n<p><strong>Transactions reflect exact parking duration?</strong> There are cases when driver buys 20 minutes to park but leaves after 10 minutes. In couple minutes this spot gets occupied by another car that also creates a transaction. That can influence our estimations of parking space capacity by making it bigger.</p>\\n<p><strong>Are there special tariffs?</strong> In a case when residents don’t pay for the parking they will occupy a spot but it will not create a transaction.
