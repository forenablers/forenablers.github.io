Sounds crazy but rather cool, isnâ€™t it? Consider high-speed train heading to Berlin with 100+ participants spread over two train wagons. Here at <a href="https://parkmobile.nl">Parkmobile</a>, we like cool things and the spirit of innovation, needless to say, I\'m in!</p>\n<p><img src="./images/train.jpg" alt="Hackatrain 2018"></p>\n<h2>Diving deeper</h2>\n<p>You probably think that a hackathon looks like this:</p>\n<p><img src="./images/beer.jpg" alt="Drinking beer"></p>\n<p>Yeah right, I wish. The beers will come later. First get your hands dirty:</p>\n<p><img src="./images/begin.jpg" alt="Working hard"></p>\n<p>There were 14 teams with 6 participants in each team. A team contains a few software developers (usually 2-3), scientists and 1-2 students (completely non-IT folks). For example, there were two students in Theatre and Performance Studies in my team. There are also people outside of the teams: coaches, mentors and support staff. Time is very limited and you start coding only in the evening of Day 1 (certainly after dinner and a few beers) while pitches start at 2:00 PM on the Day 2. The winning team gets 5, 000 euro gross.</p>\n<p>Parkmobile mates\n<img src="./images/Parkmobile.jpg" alt="Hackatrain 2018"></p>\n<h2>Lessons learned</h2>\n<p><em>I do hate scrolling down all the way to the bottom of the page to see what really matters. Hence I break the rules and put important stuff right here.</em></p>\n<p>There are a few key points I took from this event. There are actually a lot more of them, but here I list crucial only:  </p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href="https://parkmobile.nl">Parkmobile</a> is a great company! Ahaha, now seriously. Having talked to the other participants (huh, competitors!) I clearly see that <a href="https://parkmobile.nl">Parkmobile</a> invests much more into innovation and technical development of our people. Perhaps because we are part of BMW Group. Or, let\'s be honest, that\'s why we are part of BMW Group.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Acceptance criteria. Ask how the jury is going to choose the winner. We were all surprised with the choice...</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Communication. People like to talk and they do talk a lot, a lot more than needed. Absolutely neither listening nor analyzing what others have just said. And they try to make a <del>useless</del> point and then they try to prove their point. And you have to learn how to stop those useless discussions and wasting the time and instead keep the team\'s focus on the challenge. That is the best you can gain from hackathons</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Time management. Oh how many participants I\'ve seen in panic mode on the Day 2, especially closer to the pitch time. Finally they realize how much time they wasted on nothing. Hackathon is a great excercise that builds discipline</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Teamwork. Don\'t do the same mistake when you want to sit alone doing <strong>your part</strong>. You will end up with typical problem: your part works pretty well, however whole solution does not work at all.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Energy and drive. Every team needs someone energetic and proactive. A team is loosing the willingness to win as soon as they encounter unexpected issues. Thus form the team in such a way that you have at least one <strong>energetic doer</strong>. Someone who pushes forward and does not give up.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Go to the first row if you want nice pictures afterwards. Seriously, those lazy photographers did not bother taking pictures of people further than 1-2 row. Sit in the first row during all events and you become a star :)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Challenge</h2>\n<p>The challenge was kept a secret till the very last moment, before we got into the train.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You are going to the concert that ends late at night. Develop the solution by utilizing Mobility-As-A-Service, 3rd party API and Blockchain to help the users return home in time and according to their preferences.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Solution is not a big deal. The 3rd party API are well specified, we\'ve got the specs from 9292, NS train ad Parkmobile. This covers all the transport and logistics from train and buses to cars and even parking lots. The main problem was a blockchain. What are you going to use it for??</p>\n<h2>Solution</h2>\n<p>High-level architecture\n<img src="./images/solution.png" alt="Solution Architecture"></p>\n<p>User interface written in python\n<img src="./images/solution2.png" alt="Frontend"></p>\n<p>IBM Hyperledger Fabric model\n<img src="./images/blockchain.png" alt="Blockchain"></p>\n<h2>Day 1</h2>\n<p>We gathered in Amsterdam Central Station at 8:30 AM, had breakfast and met our teams. A few minutes to socialise and we were ready to get on the train.</p>\n<p><img src="./images/outtrain.jpg" alt="Getting into train"></p>\n<p>Train is full. Berlin, here we come!\n<img src="./images/start.jpg" alt="Start"></p>\n<p>That was quite warm weather and it was incredibly hot inside the train. We had to change our sweaty T-shirts every now and then.</p>\n<p>Finally the team sits together and we begin brainstorming.\n<img src="./images/cards.jpg" alt="Cards"></p>\n<p>At that moment, the main challenge was to stay together and follow the discussion. A lot of people constantly passing nearby were distracting us\n<img src="./images/brainstorming.jpg" alt="Brainstorming"></p>\n<p>And the next distraction was that noise produced by all of us. And that fluffy unicorn\n<img src="./images/unicorn.jpg" alt="Unicorn"></p>\n<p>In a few more hours we were completely exhausted, and finally silence came to the stage.\n<img src="./images/silence.jpg" alt="Silence"></p>\n<p>Ho-ho-ho. 100+ geeks in front of Berlin Central Station.\n<img src="./images/arrived.jpg" alt="Arrived"></p>\n<p>On site. Everybody is looking for a cozy place for the team.\n<img src="./images/venue.jpg" alt="Venue"></p>\n<p>Time for dinner.\n<img src="./images/dinner.jpg" alt="Dinner"></p>\n<p>Let the coding fun begin!\n<img src="./images/begincoding.jpg" alt="Coding"></p>\n<p>And the coding continues at night\n<img src="./images/codingnight.jpg" alt="Coding"></p>\n<p>Best of late-night\n<img src="./images/codinglatenight.jpg" alt="Coding"></p>\n<p>Very late at night\n<img src="./images/coding.jpg" alt="Coding"></p>\n<p>It\'s almost morning\n<img src="./images/codingverylatenight.jpg" alt="Coding"></p>\n<h2>Day 2</h2>\n<p>Next day we started at 7:00 AM. Quick breakfast and using a car sharing <a href="https://www.drive-now.com/de/en">DriveNow</a> to get back to the venue\n<img src="./images/drivenow.jpg" alt="DriveNow"></p>\n<p>Covertible helps to wake up\n<img src="./images/drivenowwakeup.jpg" alt="Convertible"></p>\n<p>Creating the presentation\n<img src="./images/presentation.jpg" alt="Drawings"></p>\n<p>Getting ready for the pitch\n<img src="./images/drawings.jpg" alt="Drawings"></p>\n<p>The pitch is ready and looks promising\n<img src="./images/pitch.jpg" alt="Pitch"></p>\n<h2>In the meantime</h2>\n<p>We found ParkNow advertisement (ParkNow is our brand in Germany)\n<img src="./images/parknow.jpg" alt="ParkNow"></p>\n<p>And this strange guy in front of The Berlin Wall\n<img src="./images/lol.jpg" alt="Strange guy"></p>\n<p>And the bike sharing services. Lime E-bike vs orange city bike\n<img src="./images/bikesharing.jpg" alt="Bike sharing"></p>\n<p>Oh, look at this! There is Mercedes A-class from Car2Go\n<img src="./images/car2go.jpg" alt="Bike sharing"></p>\n<p>Or better this GLA-class? Certainly we tried both :)\n<img src="./images/car2go2.jpg" alt="Bike sharing"></p>\n<h2>Back to Pitch</h2>\n<p>Let the fun begin! Zahy is on fire\n<img src="./images/pitchpresenting.jpg" alt="Zahy team"></p>\n<p>Lucas is invisible. There is his team is presenting\n<img src="./images/lucasteam.jpg" alt="Lucas team"></p>\n<p>And here is my team presenting\n<img src="./images/haas.jpg" alt="Haas team"></p>\n<p>Done. Jury is deciding\n<img src="./images/jury.jpg" alt="Jury"></p>\n<p>Ah, and the sweaty winners. They worked hard\n<img src="./images/winners.jpg" alt="Winners"></p>\n<p>It was great event and a lot of fun. We\'ve gained great experience and made new connections, especially guys from IBM and ING.</p>\n<p>Time to go home\n<img src="./images/home.jpg" alt="Back home"></p>\n<p>Tired but happy!\n<img src="./images/back.jpg" alt="Back home"></p>',frontmatter:{title:"Hackatrain 2018",date:"June 20, 2018",author:"Borys Generalov",authorProfileLink:null}}},pathContext:{slug:"/hackatrain2018/",previous:{fields:{slug:"/javascript-buzzy/"},frontmatter:{title:"Weird Javascript: Buzzy statement"}},next:{fields:{slug:"/microservice-timeout/"},frontmatter:{title:"Microservices: Handling timeouts"}}}}}});
